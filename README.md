# wordle-but-python-CLI-
This is my first github project. I've only done the "get started in less than an hour" project as of first originally writing this, so things are gonna get messy.

I've made something similar to this before for homework, but I wanted to develop it further to keep my python skills fresh over the break.

UPDATE March 2025:
I've came back to learning python on my own time as I totally forgot that numpy blasts all the calculators out of the water. Been using it to help with approximate integration. I've also began messing with tkinter, so a GUI version of wordle-but-python may be coming into development soon. But considering I'm already trying to learn C++, it will be more of a backburner project.


Timeline:
-Januaryish 2025: made v1-v4 prototypes over the span of a week

-March 2025: Plans to make seperate file to get 5 letter words off of (practicing file io), began learning tkinter (GUI version maybe?)

-June 13, 2025: Made seperate .txt file for storing words, made a short program that turns a list of words into easy to "r" txt for file i/o.
